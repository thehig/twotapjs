# TwoTap Client

# Scripts

### npm run convertMCart

> To simplify the cleanup process, you can run `npm run cleanMCart` which will delete the `processedCart.json.temp` and `purchaseObject.json` files

* Delete any existing `*.json.temp` files
* Delete any existing `/purchaseObject.json` from previous runs
* Place intended magento cart into `/target.json`
* Run `npm run convertMCart`
* Your ready-to-go purchase object is in `/purchaseObject.json`
* This uses userDetails and callbackConfig from the `/scripts/fixtures/` folder

# Summary

## Dataproviders

### Sample
This dataprovider uses fixture files for its data, it does not make any xhr calls.

### Callbackcatcher
This dataprovider makes requests out to our callback catcher site. It uses a twotap cart id for use on the /search route.
